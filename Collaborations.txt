This project was done by Joshua Song and Samuel Kim.

The usage of LocalTime and the idea of separating helper methods were advised by Sunny Kim, the lab assistant. 
The JavaDoc page of LocalTime was also referenced. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalTime.html

Rebecca, the prefect, helped us with implementing the inheritance of the program.
